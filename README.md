# IoT Workshop

This web page hosts the companion material for a two-day IoT workshop at the San Francisco State University.
The focus of this IoT workshop is an introduction of the Arduino-based microcontroller. In a sequence of
twelve steps, this
tutorial walks through the basics of electronics followed by various examples to show how the Arduino
can be used. Towards the end more sophisticated examples demonstrate the use of infrared for communication
as well as how an Arduino can send a notification to a regular smartphone via the Cloud. The following parts
are required for the tutorial:

* <a href="http://a.co/5hgrRdi">Arduino Starter Kit</a>
* <a href="http://a.co/dUCtlyZ">Infrared Diode and Receiver</a>
* <a href="http://a.co/j8D9G7R">FTDI USB to TTL Serial Converter Adapter</a>
* <a href="http://a.co/3dRiMDa">ESP8266</a>

A solid knowledge of programming in the C/C++ programming languages is expected. In particular, functions,
loops, and conditional statements should be understood for this tutorial. The following provides an overview
of the individual steps of this tutorial:

1. <a href="00/">Lighting up a LED</a>
